# backdoor_federated_learning
This code includes experiments for paper "How to Backdoor Federated Learning" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00459)

All experiments are done using Python 3.6 and PyTorch 1.0.

```mkdir saved_models```

```python training.py --params utils/params.yaml```


This is pretty raw version of the code and I encourage to contact me (eugene@cs.cornell.edu) or 
raise Issues in GitHub, so I can provide more details and fix bugs. 

Most of the experiments resulted by tweaking parameters in utils/params.yaml (for images) 
and utils/words.yaml (for text), you can play with them yourself.
